    "The information technology and communication have dramatically changed society, our environment and work practices. In our society, all information is stored as numbers stored on hard drives or circulating through computer networks. We interact with this information through softwares like web browsers, text editors, video etc ... This is also true for the engineers and scientists who measure, analyze and communicate their results through a chain different software. In general, these programs are sufficient to cover most of the current needs. However, with the development of these softwares, the distance between the user and his data is growing and, often, softwares tend to restrict user's freedom, power and creativity.  \n",
    "For citizens of the digital age, or modern science, a way to retrieve controle of their information is to take advantage of developments in information technologies and learn how to use powerful open softwares that are currently available. The purpose of this course is to introduce with an active approach based on the PYTHON language. This language developed by [Guido van Rossum](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) from 1980 possesses qualities that explain its rapid adoption by the scientific world. In biology, python is used in molecular modeling software (pymol, xplor ...), bioinformatics (biopython) analysis and high throughput data analysis (transcriptomic, genomic, etc ...).  \n",
    "PYHON features :  \n",
    "\n",
    "* simplicity (it uses thirty keywords and minimal punctuation)   \n",
    "* universality (PYTHON is available on PC, linux, mac)  \n",
    "* modularity (many libraries can extend the capabilities of the language)   \n",
    "* efficiency (performance written in python programs are comparable to other languages like C)   \n",

    "## Practical organisation of the course\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this course is to provide a pragmatic approach to programming in PYTHON, for writing simple scripts and exploit scientific libraries for analysis and data representation (like matplotlib). The focus will be on two types of information: text and image. We will use a PYTHON facility that allows you to write scripts through a web browser, using the ipython interface. The course will be distributed to you as ipython notebooks, (text files with .ipynb extension). You are advised to install a scientific PYTHON distribution on your personnal computer if you have one. Scientific PYTHON is installed on all ESBS computers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed approach is inspired by a very comprehensive course available on the website [developpez.com](http://python.developpez.com/cours/TutoSwinnen/), French translation of \"How to think like a computer scientist\" by Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers Jeffrey Elkner. Wherever possible, the examples that we propose will be directly related to applications in biology. A good and short introduction on the use of PYTHON in biology can be found in the paper of [Sebastian Bassi published in PLoS Computational Biology](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.0030199). After each courses, you will be assigned to do home assignments (exercises) for the next session. Small controles will be organized to follow individual progression througout the course duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow the course, you have 2 options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Jupyter on your computer using the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)\n",

    "   \n",

    "In order to work on data, it is necessary to store it within the computer memory at a precise location (called address) and be able to retrieve it thanks to a **name**. In PYTHON, all data are stored within **objects** identified by a given name and **type**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An object correspond to the data and the various programs to view or modify them. For instance, to handle a data as simple as a integer number, we can use an object of type integer (other language will call that a variable). This object will know how to perform addition, euclidian division or will allow to change the content of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A name is a series of characters that identifies the object unambiguously. A number of names are reserved by the language, such as ```and, for``` and should therefore be avoided. PYTHON differs from other languages by its very few number of [commands](http://python.developpez.com/cours/TutoSwinnen/?page=Chapitre2#L2.3). Usually a name is composed of uppercase and/or lowercase letters (Note: a is different from A PYTHON) or numbers. Punctuation characters, space or letters with accent are excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "To \"enter\" information in an object, the sign ***=*** is used. The name is placed on the left of the $=$ sign and the content is placed on the right. This content can be a mathematical expression (as adding two numbers). In this case, the interpreter PYTHON calculates the result of the expression **first**, and **then** assigns the result to the variable. This is where the **time** is involved since the same object may not have the same value while the $=$ is executed by the program. This is also why the statement:  \n",
