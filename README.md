# ESBS_Python_courses
A set of Python notebooks to introduce Python language to biologists

The course aims at introducing the Python langage from the perspective of the biological information. 
It starts by introducing the use of strings of characters, that are very close to biological sequences. for instance, object methods 
such as str.split() are introduced using analogy with restriction enzymes. 
The course is organized according the following plan:

## PYTHON_23_1
Introduction to Python langage, simple objects and string object methods.

## Python_23_2X
From string to list and dictionary objects. Iterating on objects taken from a list. Illustration with the genetic code

## Python 23_3
Making decision: the if statement and the boolean type. The while loop.
