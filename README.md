# ESBS_Python_courses
A set of Python notebooks to introduce Python language to biologists

The course aims at introducing the Python langage from the perspective of the biological information. 
It starts by introducing the use of strings of characters, that are very close to biological sequences. for instance, object methods 
such as str.split() are introduced using analogy with restriction enzymes. 
The course is organized according the following plan:

## PYTHON_23_1
Introduction to Python langage, simple objects and string object methods.

## Python_23_2
From string to list and dictionary objects. Iterating on objects taken from a list. Illustration with the genetic code

## Python 23_3
Making decision: the if statement and the boolean type. The while loop.

## Python_23_4
Organizing the code by defining functions. function arguments. Recursive call to a function

## Python_23_5
Input/Output: reading and writing data to a file. The import command with the os library. Exchanging data with Excel through csv files.

## PY_ESBS_TD1
A set of exercises to handle string objects to perform simple tasks on biological sequences (DNA, proteins)

## PY_ESBS_TD2
A set of exercises based on the turtle module to draw a plasmid map. The purpose is to understand how to define simple bricks of code and as python functions and assemble them to perform complex tasks.

## PY_ESBS_TD3
Introducing Numpy/Scipy to handle protein coordinates, from reading a PDB file to perform simple geometrical calculations (distances, angles). Use of Matplotlib for plotting.
